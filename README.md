# Hyperledger Labs

Hyperledger Labs provides a space (i.e., GitHub repos) where work can
easily be started without the creation of a project. Please refer to
the [Hyperledger Labs wiki page](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/labs)
for additional information.

## Process to propose a new lab

Fork the [hyperledger-labs.github.io](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io) repository.

Fill out the [Proposal Template](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/blob/master/proposal-template.md)
and save it into the labs subdirectory under the name of your lab,
such as mynewlab.md. It is expected that your lab repository will have
the same name so keep that in mind.

Submit a Pull Request.

The labs stewards will then review your proposal.

## Bringing in an existing repository

By default the Lab stewards will create a new respository for you to
start from but if you have an existing github repo you would like to
bring to your proposed lab you have the option to request for that
repo to be reused instead. This is however only possible if every
commit in your existing repo is signed-off so there is no 
[DCO](https://developercertificate.org/) related issues. If that is 
not the case, you will need to bring your code by squashing all of 
your commits into a single first commit made against your new lab 
repo with your sign-off.
